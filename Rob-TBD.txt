This is a copy of the admin UI flask code.

1) Leave current functionality in place.

2) Add what I need to implement the notification service.


Later: Write a generic Flask API service which uses this as a sub module.
- Use the Admin-Flask blueprints as a starting point.
- Convert the Admin-UI to use this new generic Flask service.
- Add in support for EDU UI.
- Add in support for Sci UI.
